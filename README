FrontCam

This App shows the live picture of the front camera of a Pre 3.

Tapping the live picture will take a picture and store it under 
  /.de.u32.frontcam/live.jpg 
in the USB filesystem of your pre. 



Maybe this app works also on the touchpad, but in the emulator it did not.

There is no need to run this app on Pre, Pre+, Pre 2, Pixi or Pixi+, they do not have a front cam.
