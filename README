Uses http://code.google.com/p/zxing/ (the c++ part)
for decoding (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

Building:
  copy Makefile.custom.example to Makefile.custom
  and adjust it to your setup

  then just type make (or make package install)
  needs GNU make!


Although the PDK is only available for Windows, you can just copy the PDK directory to /opt/PalmPDK
and use the headers and libraries to link for the device (host mode obviously not supported).
If you copy the libs from the emulator make TARGET=emu might work too.

You can build a test command line interface for your host:
  make TARGET=host testcli
  ./build-host/qdecode-test some-image.jpg

The zxing library checkout still has the svn entries, so you should
be able to update it if you want with "svn up" in src/zxing/
