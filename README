FrontCam

This app shows the live picture of the front camera of a Pre 3 and HP TouchPad
There is no need to run this app on Pre, Pre+, Pre 2, Pixi or Pixi+, they do 
not have a front cam.

Tapping the live picture will take a picture and save it in the usual place, 
so the webos photo viewing app can be used for viewing. 

the pictures file are named like the photo renaming patches, eg. 
   pre_2012-11-21-200357-f.jpg


Remarks:
* Any music player app stops playing when Frontcam is running. This seem to be
  a limitation of webOS, because the webos camera app shows the same behaviour 
  

FrontCam is based on the app "Palm Pre QR offline Decoder"

(Danke, Stefan!)
