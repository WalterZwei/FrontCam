Uses http://code.google.com/p/zxing/ (the c++ part)
for decoding (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

Building:
  copy Makefile.custom.example to Makefile.custom
  and adjust it to your setup

  then just type make (or make package install)
  needs GNU make!


emulator works too with TARGET=emulator (jail on emulator has a small bug, you need to setup a /dev/fb -> fb0 link manually).
Also g++ 4.6 didn't work well with exceptions, using CXX=g++-4.4 fixed the issues.

You can build a test command line interface for your host:
  make TARGET=host testcli
  ./build-host/qdecode-test some-image.jpg

The zxing library checkout still has the svn entries, so you should
be able to update it if you want with "svn up" in src/zxing/
