FrontCam

This app shows the live picture of the front camera of a Pre 3 and HP TouchPad

Tapping the live picture will take a picture and save it in the usual place, 
so the webos photo viewing app can be used for viewing. 

Photos are now named like the photo renaming patches, eg. pre_2012-11-21-200357-f.jpg

There is no need to run this app on Pre, Pre+, Pre 2, Pixi or Pixi+, they do not have a front cam.

FrontCam is based on the app  "Palm Pre QR offline Decoder"
